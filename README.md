# Basic-Verilog-Fpga-Projects

All projects were implemented on a Nexys A7-100T FPGA development board.  

Calculator - Developed a calculator that can do addition, subtraction, and multiplication. Addition and subtraction use signed numbers while multiplication uses unsigned numbers. The addition is implemented through the use of half adders and the numbers are displayed on the onboard 7-Segment displays.
